A key measure is that posted workers are now entitled</p><p id="p189">to the same remuneration as local workers.</p><p id="p190">However, regarding the reimbursement of posting related expenses, the revised directive</p><p id="p191">provides that such expenses shall be reimbursed in accordance with the national law</p><p id="p192">and/or practice applicable to the employment relationship, i.e. the law or the practice in</p><p id="p193">the sending country (hereafter “country of origin-principle”). In connection with the right</p><p id="p194">to equal remuneration, one of the provisions of the 2018 Directive deals with the so-called</p><p id="p195">“posting allowances”</p><p id="p196">which are usually paid to posted workers in order to reach the</p><p id="p197">amount of remuneration due in the country of temporary assignment. To avoid the risk</p><p id="p198">that the posting allowance is used for the purpose of reimbursing expenditure, the revised</p><p id="p199">directive provides that it is part of remuneration unless it is paid in reimbursement of</p><p id="p200">expenditure actually incurred on account of the posting, such as expenditure on travel,</p><p id="p201">board and lodging.</p><p id="p202">For this purpose, a legal</p><p id="p203">presumption</p><p id="p204">has been added in the revised</p><p id="p205">directive: where the terms and conditions of employment applicable to the employment</p><p id="p206">relationship do not determine whether and, if so, which elements of the allowance specific</p><p id="p207">to the posting are paid in reimbursement of expenditure actually incurred on account of</p><p id="p208">the posting or which are part of remuneration, then the entire allowance must be</p><p id="p209">considered to be paid in reimbursement of expenditure.</p><p id="p210">The official</p><p id="p211">report released by the Commission on 30 April 2024</p><p id="p212">on the application</p><p id="p213">and implementation of the revised Posting Directive indicates that not all Member States</p><p id="p214">have already transposed the abovementioned country of origin-principle regarding the</p><p id="p215">reimbursement of posting related expenses as well as the legal presumption.</p><p id="p216">The purpose of the study initiated by the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs</p><p id="p217">(Seco) is to analyse how selected Member States (receiving and sending MS) have</p><p id="p218">implemented these new elements of the revised directive, i.e., the abovementioned</p><p id="p219">country of origin-principle regarding the reimbursement of posting related expenses as</p><p id="p220">well as the abovementioned legal presumption, and the extent to which national</p><p id="p221">authorities in those Member States are enforcing the rules in practice.</p><p id="p222">To carry out the study,</p><p id="p223">8 “receiving countries” (Austria, Belgium, Denmark,</p><p id="p224">Finland, France, Germany, Italy and Norway)</p><p id="p225">and</p><p id="p226">6 “sending countries” (Croatia,</p><p id="p227">Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia)</p><p id="p228">have been selected.</p><p id="p229">The report shows that among the</p><p id="p230">8 receiving countries</p><p id="p231">, not all of them incorporate</p><p id="p232">enforcement measures of the presumption. When they do so, the enforcement rules are</p><p id="p233">general.</p><p id="p234">It is likely that the terms of “posting allowance”, “daily allowance” and “lump sum</p><p id="p235">payments” are, in most cases, taken at face value, meaning that that the payments made</p><p id="p236">through these terms are included in the scope of remuneration, although they may in fact</p><p id="p237">correspond to actual reimbursement of expenses. There is no indication as regards the</p><p id="p238">reality, the depth and intensity of checks operated by control bodies (such as labour</p><p id="p239">inspectors).</p><p id="p240">Nevertheless, it is not yet possible to draw any definite conclusions about the specific</p><p id="p241">enforcement or implementation models of all countries. The abovementioned country of</p><p id="p242">origin-principle regarding the reimbursement of posting related expenses as well as the</p><p id="p243">legal presumption are new and require from national authorities implementing measures</p><p id="p244">at national and local level. In particular, the application of detailed guidance for labour</p><p id="p245">inspectors on the conditions to be met to trigger the legal presumption and clear processes</p><p id="p246">for inspections must be devised. A good information system for foreign employers takes</p><p id="p247">time to be built.</p><p id="p248">At this stage, it is unclear whether the Commission evaluates Member States’</p><p id="p249">implementation of these elements (country of origin-principle and legal presumption) as</p><h2 id="h11"></h2><p id="p250">2</p><p id="p251">in conformity with EU law or if and when it would launch infringement procedures against</p><p id="p252">Member States.

After all, it is worth mentioning that national laws, collective agreements or</p><p id="p261">companies’ internal regulations and/or employment contracts in sending countries, allow</p><p id="p262">for the reimbursement of posting related expenses to workers.</p><h2 id="h12"></h2><p id="p263">3</p><h1 id="p7">1.</h1><h1 id="p8">Introduction</h1><h2 id="p13">1.1.</h2><h2 id="p14">Context of the posting allowance and reimbursement</h2><h2 id="p15">of costs</h2><p id="p264">The Revised Posting of Workers Directive 2018/957/EU (amending Directive 96/71/EC,</p><p id="p265">hereafter, “the Posting Directive”) defines the mandatory rules in relation to the terms and</p><p id="p266">conditions of employment which have to be applied to posted workers.</p><p id="p267">As a general rule, the</p><p id="p268">mandatory terms and conditions of employment</p><p id="p269">,</p><p id="p270">which are</p><p id="p271">in place in the receiving (host)</p><p id="p272">1</p><p id="p273">Member State</p><p id="p274">2</p><p id="p275">- also called the “hardcore” provisions</p><p id="p276">3</p><p id="p277">in the context of the Posting Directive –</p><p id="p278">apply</p><p id="p279">to posted workers to the extent that they</p><p id="p280">are more favourable than those guaranteed by the employment law of the sending (home)</p><p id="p281">4</p><p id="p282">Member State (or the law applicable to the employment contract).</p><p id="p283">The matter of</p><p id="p284">‘posting-related expenses’</p><p id="p285">, which should fall outside the scope of the</p><p id="p286">hardcore provisions (and which therefore are to be reimbursed in accordance with the laws</p><p id="p287">and/or practice of the sending country) and, one side, the conditions of workers’</p><p id="p288">accommodation” and, on the other side, the</p><p id="p289">‘expenses covering travel, board and</p><p id="p290">lodging’</p><p id="p291">, which are both listed in the hardcore provisions, is dealt with in various</p><p id="p292">provisions of the Posting Directive.

The</p><p id="p1585">collective agreement applicable in the construction sector provides a rule for out-</p><p id="p1586">going posted workers which is hard to interpret</p><p id="p1587">. As a principle, it is stated that “</p><p id="p1588">On</p><p id="p1589">construction sites in foreign countries, the Annex to the Collective Agreement applying to</p><p id="p1590">posted workers applies to them when working abroad if this does not conflict with the</p><p id="p1591">regulations of the country of work</p><p id="p1592">(i.e., receiving country)”.

As a rule, the employer provides the posted</p><p id="p1598">worker with the "Additional Payment for Posting" by providing accommodation or paying</p><p id="p1599">compensation for accommodation. The amount of compensation referred to in paragraph</p><p id="p1600">2 of this article is determined by the employer, depending on the amount of actual</p><p id="p1601">accommodation costs</p><p id="p1602">” (HR). Concretely, it would mean that if a worker is posted to</p><p id="p1603">countries where wages are higher, the posted worker’s rights are reduced for the amount</p><p id="p1604">of "Additional Payment for Posting" which is intended to cover accommodation costs. For</p><p id="p1605">example, if the salary would be € 2000 in Croatia and € 4000 in the receiving country, and</p><p id="p1606">if the employer should pay accommodation costs of €1000 if the work was carried out in</p><p id="p1607">Croatia, the sending employer should finally pay only a total remuneration of €4000</p><p id="p1608">(including the accommodation costs), instead of €5000.

This situation</p><p id="p1863">is essentially due to the fact that the rules of the home country are applicable to such</p><p id="p1864">reimbursements, and not the rules of the receiving country, making it complicated from a</p><p id="p1865">practical point of view to provide enforcement measures.</p><p id="p1866">Firstly,</p><p id="p1867">only few receiving countries incorporate enforcement measures of Article</p><p id="p1868">3 (7)</p><p id="p1869">. When they do so, the measures are fairly general and do not target the</p><p id="p1870">reimbursement of costs.</p><p id="p1871">Secondly, it is likely that the</p><p id="p1872">terms of “posting allowance”, “daily allowance” and</p><p id="p1873">“lump sum payments” are in most cases taken at face value in receiving Member</p><p id="p1874">States</p><p id="p1875">, meaning that that the payments made through these terms are included in the</p><p id="p1876">scope of remuneration, although they may in fact correspond to actual reimbursement of</p><p id="p1877">expenses. Control bodies can usually question the exact purpose of the amounts paid by</p><p id="p1878">the sending employer, and whether they conceal the reimbursement of actual costs, but</p><p id="p1879">there is no indication as regards the reality, the depth and intensity of such</p><p id="p1880">controls</p><p id="p1881">. Some Member States seem to be more active in terms of effective controls, but</p><p id="p1882">there is no data to confirm this trend (BE, FI).</p><p id="p1883">Thirdly,</p><p id="p1884">most receiving Member States do not attach importance to the</p><p id="p1885">presumption of Article 3(7)</p><p id="p1886">that where the terms and conditions of employment</p><p id="p1887">applicable to the employment relationship do not determine whether and, if so, which</p><p id="p1888">elements of the allowance specific to the posting are paid in reimbursement of expenditure</p><p id="p1889">actually incurred on account of the posting or which are part of remuneration, then the</p><p id="p1890">entire allowance shall be considered to be paid in reimbursement of expenditure. The fact</p><p id="p1891">that the pay slip mentions as an element of remuneration a posting allowance or a daily</p><p id="p1892">allowance (per diem), without referring to expenses, is not sufficient to trigger the</p><p id="p1893">presumption. Further analysis is conducted by labour inspections, often at their own</p><p id="p1894">initiative, to identify the nature of payments made.</p><p id="p1895">Fourthly,</p><p id="p1896">controls by receiving countries of the reality of reimbursement of costs</p><p id="p1897">such as provided by the legislation of the home Member State (or according to</p><p id="p1898">the practice applicable to the employment relationship) are apparently low</p><p id="p1899">. When</p><p id="p1900">they are done, it is mainly through the posted worker's payslip, and in that case the control</p><p id="p1901">process focuses on remuneration rather than on reimbursement of expenses. This looks</p><p id="p1902">like a major gap in the implementation of Article 3(7) in a context where the home country</p><p id="p1903">rules/practices</p><p id="p1904">regarding</p><p id="p1905">the</p><p id="p1906">posted</p><p id="p1907">workers’</p><p id="p1908">rights</p><p id="p1909">in</p><p id="p1910">terms</p><p id="p1911">of</p><p id="p1912">remuneration/reimbursement of costs can be hard to identify and to understand, their</p><p id="p1913">conformity with the Posting Directive being questionable. In the same vein, there is little</p><p id="p1914">awareness of, and action on, the issue of the sending employer having to prove that he</p><p id="p1915">does not have to reimburse expenses according to the home Member State rules.</p><p id="p1916">This said,</p><p id="p1917">one country seems more advanced in the application of Article 3(7) and</p><p id="p1918">indicates the existence of a consistent case law</p><p id="p1919">60</p><p id="p1920">where, in each case, the nature</p><p id="p1921">of the payment is assessed, and the presumption is that posting allowances are</p><p id="p1922">not part of the remuneration</p><p id="p1923">.</p><p id="p1924">The employers must prove otherwise if they want</p><p id="p1925">to be able to count the payments toward the total gross-payment</p><p id="p1926">(DK).</p><p id="p1927">60</p><p id="p1928">Which can be found in the Danish fiche completed for this report.</p><h2 id="h110"></h2><p id="p1929">32</p><p id="p1930">Nevertheless, it is not yet possible to draw any definite conclusions about the specific</p><p id="p1931">enforcement or implementation models of all countries (such as, for instance, Belgium,</p><p id="p1932">Denmark, Finland or France). The country of origin-principle regarding the reimbursement</p><p id="p1933">of posting related expenses as well as the legal presumption are new and require from</p><p id="p1934">national authorities implementing measures at national and local level. In particular, the</p><p id="p1935">application of detailed guidance for labour inspectors on the conditions to be met to trigger</p><p id="p1936">the presumption and clear processes for inspections must be devised. At this stage, it is</p><p id="p1937">unclear whether the Commission evaluates Member States’ implementation of these</p><p id="p1938">elements (country of origin principle and legal presumption) as in conformity with EU law</p><p id="p1939">or if and when it would launch infringement procedures.

In the construction sector, except in</p><p id="p1960">Croatia, the matter of the posting allowance is not regulated specifically.
